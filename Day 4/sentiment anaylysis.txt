A sentiment analysis system for text analysis combines natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to assign weighted sentiment scores to the entities, topics, themes and categories within a sentence or phrase.

Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as neural networks and deep learning, the model will learn what nouns look like
